To be clear. The content here is a content based on a free course. Noone can reproduce this material. If you wanna to know this material, my advice is to you access the **free** [course](https://web.dio.me/track/coding-the-future-claro-java-spring-boot). And if they end the course or start to ask money to study in the course? Well, this considerations are out of my control, but the DIO material is excelent and the course is amazing! If you acquire a DIO paln, you will have access to amazing courses.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
